# Sustainability Analysis SQL Project
Advanced SQL Analysis on Global Energy Consumption Data

## Project Overview

- **Project Title**: Sustainability Analysis on Global Energy Consumption  
- **Level**: Advanced  
- **Database Name**: `sustainability`  

This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze global energy data from 2000 to 2024. It includes a focused study on the COVID lockdown period (2020â€“2022) to evaluate how different countries practiced sustainability.

The analysis uses custom metrics such as sustainable choices and sustainability goals to assess environmental progress.

## Objectives

1. Set up a sustainability database with structured global energy data  
2. Clean and validate data by removing nulls, duplicates, and detecting outliers  
3. Explore the dataset to understand country/year coverage and data consistency  
4. Calculate derived metrics for more meaningful analysis  
5. Answer key sustainability questions using advanced SQL techniques

## Key Metric Definitions

- **Sustainable Choices**: A country is considered to make a sustainable choice if its renewable energy consumption exceeds fossil fuel consumption.  
- **Sustainability Goals Achieved**: A country achieves sustainability goals if it increases per capita energy use and simultaneously decreases total carbon emissions compared to the previous year.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- Database creation and table setup using SQL DDL.
- Table `global_energy_data` is used to store energy metrics.

```sql
create database sustainability;

create table global_energy_data
(Country text, 
Year int, 
Total_Energy_Consumption double, 
Per_Capita_Energy_Use double, 
Renewable_Energy_Share double, 
Fossil_Fuel_Dependency double, 
Industrial_Energy_Use double, 
Household_Energy_Use double, 
Carbon_Emissions double, 
Energy_Price_Index double);
````

### 2. Data Cleaning

* Described table structure
* Changed data type of `Year` column to `YEAR`
* Checked null values
* Checked and filtered duplicate records
* Identified outliers using standard deviation-based thresholds

```sql
describe global_energy_data;

alter table global_energy_data
modify column Year Year;

select * from global_energy_data
where Country is null or
Year is null or
Total_Energy_Consumption is null or
Per_Capita_Energy_Use is null or
Renewable_Energy_Share is null or
Fossil_Fuel_Dependency is null or
Industrial_Energy_Use is null or
Household_Energy_Use is null or
Carbon_Emissions is null or
Energy_Price_Index is null;

select * from global_energy_data
group by Country,Year,Total_Energy_Consumption,Per_Capita_Energy_Use,Renewable_Energy_Share,Fossil_Fuel_Dependency,Industrial_Energy_Use,
Household_Energy_Use,Carbon_Emissions,Energy_Price_Index
having count(*)>1;

with average as(select round(avg(Total_Energy_Consumption),2) as avg_Total_Energy_Consumption,round(std(Total_Energy_Consumption),2) as std_Total_Energy_Consumption,round(avg(Per_Capita_Energy_Use),2) as avg_Per_Capita_Energy_Use,round(std(Per_Capita_Energy_Use),2) as std_Per_Capita_Energy_Use,
round(avg(Renewable_Energy_Share),2) as avg_Renewable_Energy_Share,round(std(Renewable_Energy_Share),2) as std_Renewable_Energy_Share,
round(avg(Fossil_Fuel_Dependency),2) as avg_Fossil_Fuel_Dependency,round(std(Fossil_Fuel_Dependency),2) as std_Fossil_Fuel_Dependency,
round(avg(Industrial_Energy_Use),2) as avg_Industrial_Energy_Use,round(std(Industrial_Energy_Use),2) as std_Industrial_Energy_Use,
round(avg(Household_Energy_Use),2) as avg_Household_Energy_Use,round(std(Household_Energy_Use),2) as std_Household_Energy_Use,
round(avg(Carbon_Emissions),2) as avg_Carbon_Emissions,round(std(Carbon_Emissions),2) as std_Carbon_Emissions from global_energy_data)
select * from global_energy_data
where abs(Total_Energy_Consumption-(select avg_Total_Energy_Consumption from average))>3*(select std_Total_Energy_Consumption from average) or
abs(Renewable_Energy_Share-(select avg_Renewable_Energy_Share from average))>3*(select std_Renewable_Energy_Share from average) or
abs(Fossil_Fuel_Dependency-(select avg_Fossil_Fuel_Dependency from average))>3*(select std_Fossil_Fuel_Dependency from average) or
abs(Industrial_Energy_Use-(select avg_Industrial_Energy_Use from average))>3*(select std_Industrial_Energy_Use from average) or
abs(Household_Energy_Use-(select avg_Household_Energy_Use from average))>3*(select std_Household_Energy_Use from average) or
abs(Carbon_Emissions-(select avg_Carbon_Emissions from average))>3*(select std_Carbon_Emissions from average);  
```

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

* Counted total records, unique countries, and years
* Checked year-wise data availability for each country

```sql
select count(*) as no_of_records from global_energy_data;

select count(distinct Country) as total_countries from global_energy_data;

select count(distinct Year) as total_year from global_energy_data;

select Country,count( distinct Year) as years_data_available from global_energy_data 
group by Country;

select Country,Year,count(*) as record from global_energy_data 
group by Country,Year;
```

### 4. Parameter Calculations

Derived columns:

* `Renewable_Energy`, `Fossil_Fuel`, `Industrial_Energy`, `Household_Energy` in TWh
* Estimated `population` using:
  `population = (Total_Energy_Consumption * 1e9) / Per_Capita_Energy_Use`
  
These values were added to the main table for further analysis.

```sql
alter table global_energy_data
add Renewable_Energy double,
add Fossil_Fuel double,
add Industrial_Energy double,
add Household_Energy double,
add population bigint;

update global_energy_data
set Renewable_Energy=round(Renewable_Energy_Share*Total_Energy_Consumption*0.01,2),
Fossil_Fuel=round(Fossil_Fuel_Dependency*Total_Energy_Consumption*0.01,2),
Industrial_Energy=round(Industrial_Energy_Use*Total_Energy_Consumption*0.01,2),
Household_Energy=round(Household_Energy_Use*Total_Energy_Consumption*0.01,2),
population=round((Total_Energy_Consumption*pow(10,9)/Per_Capita_Energy_Use),0);
```

### 5. View Creation

Created a view `energy_global` to simplify queries with aggregated and calculated metrics per country per year.

```sql
create view energy_global
as select Country,Year,round(sum(Total_Energy_Consumption),2) as Total_Energy_Consumed,round(sum(Total_Energy_Consumption)*pow(10,9)/sum(population),2) as Per_Capita_Energy_Use,
round(sum(Renewable_Energy),2) as Total_RW_Energy,round(sum(Fossil_Fuel),2) as Total_FF,round(sum(Industrial_Energy),2) as Total_Ind_Energy,
round(sum(Household_Energy),2) as Total_House_Energy,round(sum(Carbon_Emissions),2) as Total_Carbon_Emission 
from global_energy_data 
group by Country,Year
order by Year asc,Country asc;
```

### 6. Analysis

## Findings

- **Australia, Canada, and Russia** made sustainable choices for 18 years each during 2000â€“2024, the highest among all countries. During the COVID-19 lockdown (2020â€“2022), **Canada** and **India** led with 3 sustainable years each.
- **China** achieved sustainability goals (increased per capita energy use and decreased emissions) in 9 out of 25 years between 2000 and 2024, the highest among all countries. During the COVID period (2020â€“2022), 7 out of 10 countries achieved the goal for at least 1 of the 3 years.
- From 2000â€“2024, **Russia** contributed the lowest share of total emissions (9.5%) while the **USA** contributed the highest (10.42%). During COVID, **Japan** had the lowest contribution (7.15%) and the **USA** the highest (11.78%).
