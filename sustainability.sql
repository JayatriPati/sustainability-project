/*** This sustainability project in this I analyse:
1)On an average how many countries are acheieving sustainability goals or practice sustainability during 2000-2024 and covid lockdown(2020-2022)
2)Each country how many years out of 2000-2024 and covid lockdown(2020-2022) were able to cheieving sustaibility goals or practice sustaibility
